# VGG16-TF
TensorFlow implementation of the training version of VGG16

This is a trainable version of VGG 16 on TensorFlow. Everything is being trained from scratch!

We are also gonna add Generalized version of Trainable VGG19 in the future.

In Caltech256, the pretrained model of Caltech 101 was used and we trained only the last layer using caltech 256 dataset.
